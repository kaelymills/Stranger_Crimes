A community dedicated to theorizing, conspirasizing and solving the strangest crimes. Add cold cases or contribute to solving current ones. Thereâ€™s only one rule: never keep the curiosity door locked. 

Logic for user experience: 

    -User signs up or logs in
    -Once the user is logged in, they can view all of the cold cases and select onces to add to their profile.
    -Users can also remove selected cases from their profile.
    -Within a case, a user can save notes and articles while they are solving the case.
    -If a user feels they are particularly productive on a certain case, they can go back to the thumnail feature article and 'upvote' the case.
    -The case with the highest amount of upvotes will be featured with a public message board, where users can publicly contribute their theories to the most popular case. 
    
    
Back end logic (for our sanity):
